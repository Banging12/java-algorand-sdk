# java-algorand-sdk

AlgoSDK is a Java library for communicating and interacting with the Algorand network. It contains a REST client for accessing `algod` instances over the web,
and also exposes functionality for generating keypairs, mnemonics, creating transactions, signing transactions, and serializing data across the network.

# Prerequisites

Java 7+ and Android `minSdkVersion` 16+

# Installation

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.algorand</groupId>
    <artifactId>algosdk</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
To fetch it straight from the algorand repository, on github, also add in your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>algosdk-mvn-repo</id>
        <url>https://raw.github.com/algorand/java-algorand-sdk/mvn-repo/</url>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
            <updatePolicy>always</updatePolicy>
        </snapshots>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```


To build from source:
```
mvn clean install
```

# Quickstart

```java
package com.algorand.algosdk.example;

import com.algorand.algosdk.algod.client.ApiClient;
import com.algorand.algosdk.algod.client.ApiException;
import com.algorand.algosdk.algod.client.api.DefaultApi;
import com.algorand.algosdk.algod.client.auth.ApiKeyAuth;
import com.algorand.algosdk.algod.client.model.NodeStatus;


public class Main {

    public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {
        final String ALGOD_API_ADDR = "http://localhost:8080";
        final String ALGOD_API_TOKEN = "d6f33a522f465ff12f0d263f2c3b707ac2f560bacad4d859914ada7e827902b3";

        ApiClient client = new ApiClient().setBasePath(ALGOD_API_ADDR);
        ApiKeyAuth api_key = (ApiKeyAuth) client.getAuthentication("api_key");
        api_key.setApiKey(ALGOD_API_TOKEN);

        DefaultApi algodApiInstance = new DefaultApi(client);
        try {
            NodeStatus status = algodApiInstance.getStatus();
            System.out.println("Algorand network status: " + status);
        } catch (ApiException e) {
            System.err.println("Exception when calling algod#getStatus");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

}
```
This prints:
```
Algorand network status: class NodeStatus {
    catchupTime: 0
    lastConsensusVersion: v4
    lastRound: 260318
    nextConsensusVersion: v4
    nextConsensusVersionRound: 260319
    nextConsensusVersionSupported: true
    timeSinceLastRound: 3620331759
}
```

# Cryptography

To use the library, the SDK requires you specify a JCA provider for `Ed25519` signatures and `SHA-512/256` checksums. This SDK
is tested with `BouncyCastle 1.61` (bouncycastle.org). This SDK relies on BouncyCastle transitively; make sure to add it as a dependency (optionally).
In your applications, setup the SDK, like the following example code:

```java
import org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider;
import java.security.Security;
...
// set up crypto, in order to sign transactions
if (Security.getProvider(BouncyCastleProvider.PROVIDER_NAME) == null) {
    Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());
}
// now, do work
```

In addition, AlgoSDK depends on `org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on:1.61` for deserializing `X.509`-encoded `Ed25519` private keys. This is the only
dependency on an external crypto library - all other references are abstracted through the JCA.


# Contributing to this Project

## bazel build

This project uses `bazel` and also supports `mvn`.
In the bazel context, it uses the `maven_install` bazel rule to fetch `maven` dependencies.
More information can be found at https://blog.bazel.build/2019/03/31/rules-jvm-external-maven.html.

We should monitor the progress of features such as artifact checksumming.

To run the example project:
```
bazel run //examples/src/main/java/com/algorand/algosdk/example:example
```

To build the whole library:
`bazel build //:algosdk`

To build individual pieces:
`bazel build //:algosdk_core`
`bazel build //:algosdk_rest_api`

To test:
`bazel test //...`

To build the pom file (this auto-populates the dependencies from bazel dependencies):
```
bazel build //:algosdk_pom
```

To build specific libraries (pick and choose, e.g. for account library)
`bazel build //src/main/java/com/algorand/algosdk/account:account`

## maven support

The generated pom file provides maven compatibility and deploy capabilities.
```
mvn clean install
mvn clean deploy -P github
mvn clean deploy -P release
```
Please update the appropriate bazel files if you use maven and contribute to the project.

## Updating the `algod` and `kmd` REST clients
The `algod` and `kmd` REST clients are largely autogenerated by `swagger-codegen`. [https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen]

To regenerate the clients, first, check out the latest `swagger-codegen` from the github repo. (In particular, the Homebrew version
is out of date and fails to handle raw byte arrays properly). Then:

```
swagger-codegen generate -i http://path-of-algod-or-kmd-api/swagger.json -l java -c config.json
```

`config.json` looks like:
```json
{
  "library": "okhttp-gson",
  "java8": false,
  "hideGenerationTimestamp": true,
  "serializableModel": false,
  "supportJava6": true,
  "invokerPackage": "com.algorand.algosdk.{kmd or algod}.client",
  "apiPackage": "com.algorand.algosdk.{kmd or algod}.client.api",
  "modelPackage": "com.algorand.algosdk.{kmd or algod}.client.model"
}
```

Finally, make sure to update all (hardcoded) `BUILD.bazel` files appropriately. In particular, the generated code
(as of April 2019) has one circular dependency involving `client.Pair`. The `client` package depends on `client.auth`, but
`client.auth` uses `client.Pair` which is in the `client` package. One more problem is that `uint64` is not a valid format
in OpenAPI 2.0; however, we need to send large integers to the `algod` API (`kmd` is fine).
To resolve this, we do the following manual pass on generated code:

- Move `Pair.java` into the `client.lib` package (with appropriate `BUILD.bazel` file and renaming);
- Find-and-replace `Integer` with `Long` in `com.algorand.algosdk.algod` and subpackages;
- Run an `Optimize Imports` operation on generated code, to minimize dependencies.


# Android Support

Significant work has been taken to ensure Android compatibility (in particular for `minSdkVersion` 16). Note that the
default crypto provider on Android does not provide `ed25519` signatures, so you will need to provide your own (e.g. `BouncyCastle`).
