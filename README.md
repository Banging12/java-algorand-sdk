## Maven Dependencies
See https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-blog/pull/157. We should monitor the progress of features such as artifact checksumming.

## Example cmd
`bazel run //examples/src/main/java/com/algorand/algosdk/example:example`

## Build all libraries
`bazel build //:algosdk`

## Build specific libraries
(pick and choose)
`bazel build //src/main/java/com/algorand/algosdk/algod:algod`
`bazel build //src/main/java/com/algorand/algosdk/kmd:kmd`

## Algod/Kmd APIs
The model and interface code is largely autogenerated by swagger-codegen, namely:
`swagger-codegen generate -i http://localhost:8080/swagger.json -l java -c config.json`
and cleaned up by first: removing `Schema` annotations; second (algod only) and converting
all `uint64` formats to `int64` in `swagger.json`; third, removing extraneous imports.

`config.json` looks like:
```
{
"library": "retrofit2",
"java8": false,
"hideGenerationTimestamp": true,
"serializableModel": false,
"supportJava6": true
}
```
